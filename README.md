Use the files in "Install_Libs_Win32" to go through the native installation process for required libraries on Windows. This is only required when using Michael's method.

"Lab6_Win32" is a sample of an already-edited Lab6 source, according to the linked instructions for Aaron's method.
"Lab6_Win32_Michael" is a similar sample, but uses Michael's method instead.
